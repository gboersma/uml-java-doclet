## Overview ##

Add UML diagrams (using PlantUML) to Javadocs. Extends the standard Java doclet.

### Status ###

The doclet tool was completely changed in Java 9; uml-java-doclet will not work with any JDK later than 8.

This project is not maintained anymore, since for us it is not worth effort required to update it for later JDKs. 
However, if anyone wants to take it on, feel free to log any issues and I will do my best to answer.

### Background ###

The inspiration for this project is better communication between the developers on my team. We want to 
follow the principles of DDD and Model-Driven Design 
(https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0321125215) 
and automatically generating class diagrams is a key part of that approach.

### Diagrams ###

Generates three types of diagrams:

- Overview: Shows all classes within all packages. Click on a class to get to the Javadoc for that class.
Click on a package to get to the Javadoc for that package.
- Package: Shows all of the classes within a package, and the relationships between them. Does not
show relationships with classes outside the package.
- Class: Shows all of the relationships with other classes. If the other class is in the same package,
it is shown in yellow (default color). If in another package within the set of packages, it is shown
in white. If the other class is outside any of the packages, it is shown in grey.

The relationships with other classes are determined by what the Javadoc API provides, which is from the
attribute and method declarations for a class. Any usages that are buried within code will not be shown.
If I think a relationship is important enough to be shown, I will make it explicit (e.g. add an attribute
to the other class). 

Layouts can appear strange. This is due to the use of GraphViz. Good enough for my purposes, although
there are other options that are being explored (http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/qa/?qa=4842/graphviz-is-not-good-enough).

### Dependencies ###

- GraphViz (as required by PlantUML).
- Java 8 (easy enough to backport to earlier versions).

NOTE: The doclet tool was completely changed in Java 9; uml-java-doclet will not work with any JDK later than 8.

### Installing ###

Use http://jitpack.io to automatically build and install the JAR file. Add the JitPack repository to your POM:

	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories> 

Note: Not published to Maven Central; this is a much easier alternative.

### Generating Updated Javadocs ###

To generate UML diagrams for your own project, add the following to your POM: 

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>                                  
                <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.2.0</version>
                <configuration>
                    <doclet>info.leadinglight.umljavadoclet.UmlJavaDoclet</doclet>
                    <docletArtifact>
                        <groupId>com.github.gboersma</groupId>
                        <artifactId>uml-java-doclet</artifactId>
                        <version>1.1</version>
                    </docletArtifact>
                    <useStandardDocletOptions>true</useStandardDocletOptions>
                    <additionalOptions>
                        <!-- Specify each diagram option here as an additionOption tag. -->
                    </additionalOptions>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

Note: Version 3+ of the maven-javadoc-plugin uses the `additionalOptions` tag to specify additional javadoc tags.
The previous `additionalparam` tag no longer works correctly. Be sure to upgrade your POMs accordingly.

### Diagram Options ###

Options for the diagrams are specified as `additionalOption` tags in the POM.

|Option|Valid Values|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|-linetype|polyline,spline,ortho|ortho|Types of lines to display on diagrams|
|-dependencies|public,protected,package,private|public|What dependencies to explicitly show on the diagram|
|-package-orientation|top-to-bottom,left-to-right|top-to-bottom|Layout of packages on package diagrams|
|-output-model|true,false|false|Whether to output the details of the model (useful for debugging)|
|-puml-include-file|free-form|none|Name of PUML file to include in every diagram PUML|
|-exclude-classes|comma-separated|none|List of qualified class names to exclude from context diagrams|
|-exclude-packages|comma-separated|none|List of qualified package names to exclude from context diagrams|

### Tips ###

- To generate the Javadoc to a different folder, refer to: 
https://maven.apache.org/plugins-archives/maven-javadoc-plugin-3.2.0/examples/output-configuration.html
for how to use specify the standard doclet option.
